**Next-Generation AI-Powered Cloud Security Auditing Framework**

*Powered by xtawb | Defensive. Intelligent. Enterprise-Grade.*

CloudAudit is an enterprise-grade cloud storage security posture auditing framework.
It automatically discovers, crawls, and analyses cloud storage containers to identify
secret leakage, credential exposure, compliance gaps, and misconfigurations.

.. note::
   CloudAudit is designed for **internal defensive use only** on systems you own or
   have explicit written authorisation to audit.
